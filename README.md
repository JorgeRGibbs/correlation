# correlation
Small program to calculate correlation of two signals and generate graphs in c.

Both arrays should have the same or similar length.

execute run.sh to calculate signals that you want to write by hand and generate graphs. Graphs are saved as png files.

If you want to calculate the correlation of two signals and want to input data from files (input-x and input-h) edit the files and use pe.sh instead.
